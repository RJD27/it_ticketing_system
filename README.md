# Workflow

### Issues

Issues should be created to indicate that a feature needs to be added or a bug needs to be fixed.
Think of these like tickets. When you create an issue you can enter a title for your issue and a description,
you can then assign people to the issue, label the issue into a category, add the issue into a project, and/or
add the issue to a milestone. 

### Branches

Branches should be created when something needs to be changed. This prevents any accidental changes to the main branch.
Branches should be named as so **'issueNumber_this_is_a_branch'**, if by chance there is no issue tied to the branch it may be ommitted,
but an issue should be made prior to making the branch.

### Pull Requests

#### Opening a PR

For a branch to be merged with the main branch, a pull request aka PR is needed.
To open a PR, navigate to your branch and click **'contribute'** then **'Open Pull Request'**, this will take you to a new page
with a template PR. If your PR is still in progress, it can be marked as a draft.

#### Writing a PR

Enter a suitable title, description, and proposed changes in your PR.
At this point you can also assign a reviewer who will have the duty of reviewing and approving your code.

#### Linking Issues

To link issues to be closed once the PR has been approved, under the **'Issues'** heading use **'closes #issueNumber'** for each issue,
this will automatically link the issues and close them once the PR is approved.

#### Reviewing a PR

Before a PR is approved it must and should be reviewed by other people. This reduces bugs and improves code.
